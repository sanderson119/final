        <h2>Dream State</h2>
            <h3>In Life: I know how to get somewhere.</h3>
            <div class="white">
            <p>In Dreams: I can only see one step at a time, and come up against obstacles and delays. 
            <p>In Life: I know how to get somewhere on time.
            <p>In Dreams: I encounter obstacle after obstacle and never make it to the destination of focus.
            <p>In Life: I see the sun.
            <p>In Dreams: I'm either indoors, it's nighttime or when I am outdoors - my vision does not extent far beyond my bubble however, there is a sense of ominous clouds above or an environment that would indicate overcast sky's and dampness.
            <p>In Life: I ensure my affairs are in order, everything is in it's place.
            <p>In Dreams: I find myself without my purse, without my clothes (underwear still on) and frantically trying to reach the hotel service desk to get a free room to pull myself together due to not being able to find any of my belongings
            <p>In Life: I have trouble expressing myself with diplomacy & grace, with most of the time holding back  out of fear of hurting another.
            <p>In Dreams: I am already judged, with no explanation wanted. Outcome: others already disappointed in me, without my voice being heard.
            <p>In Life: I take care of my dental hygiene.
            <p>In Dreams: My teeth are all falling out (although it's been a while since I've experienced that particular dream), with the sensations felt in my body and a resounding WTF is happening in my brain.
            <p class="indent">Some would say, that we work out our daily lives in our dreams and if this is so,  then I am highly concerned. I don’t seem to work anything out in my dreams as I'm in a constant state  of confusion.. Trying to get to the next step… all the while feeling panic, embarrassment, confusion, and fear of disappointing someone.
            I have these feelings in my daily  life, I simply know how to mask, pretend, do all the things to have a sense of feeling as if everything is in order, that I have my shit together. I am good at keeping up appearances. Don’t get me wrong, I do have my shit together however my thoughts, and my mental state are that of what's in my dreams.</p>
            <p class="indent">Does my state of mind need to get better in order for my dreams to become happier, more uplifting, fun even? Why not have it the other way around? I am troubled by this discovery. My dreams are so crazy, I've always known this… its' this new discovery that there has always been an underlying theme.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why did it take me so long to figure out that these dreams that I've been having since I was a kid are a form of reoccurring dreams that have an actual theme? Does it benefit me to know that in my dreams I feel as if I'm lost and not measuring up to the task? I can hypothesize that my subconscious has been trying to beat this idea over my head since the way back when. That understanding my dream theme can help work things out in waking life?  This all looks like stress to me and It has been suggested from someone I admire that stress isnt real. I suppose my next step is to simply sit on that one for a while….</p>
            <p>Stay tuned!</p>
