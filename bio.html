        <h2>Susan C Anderson</h2>
        <h3> Who is this woman?</h3>
        <p class="indent">Her multifaceted and eclectic style has Susan engrossed in many passion projects, with this particular website dedicated to all things design, being one of them.
        She is currently a Computer Science student at Great Bay Community College which is located in the seacoast region of southern New Hampshire in Portsmouth. While she makes the seque into her second year with a focus on Digital Media Communications,  she has already  put together a collection of imagery and content that has been received with great reviews. Susan's passions related to digital media are, video production/editing, web site development, copy writing, photoshop creations and vlogging. The production of videos being amongst a favorite of Susan, it's not supprising one may refer to her as a "Ham". You can call her ham if you'd like to but please know, Susan hasnt eaten meat in 9 months so the judgement may bring up some controversy if you try.</p>
        <p class="indent">Now what was all this other stuff Susan has passions for? To name a few, she has recently picked up an Austin acoustic guitar named "Luna" in attempts to learn and now has a Fender Squire electric guitar named "Sade" that is found to be much easier to play than the steel strings on Luna.<br>
        Susan is also extremely passionate about learning, specifically all things metaphysical and spiritual.  Susan believes a new movement deemed "New Thought Ministry" has surfaced to the forefront allowing many to fall in love once again with spirt. Being a part of that movement has been enriching to the soul.</p>
        <p class="indent"> Be careful not to misinterpret, mas her beliefs are near and dear to the heart and the  one thing she will not do is approach an unexpecting soul by expressing my devotion in an intense and aggressive way. Everyone has their own path and however one finds deep connection with spirit is fine by me, and Spirit!  Can Unity and Individualism live together in harmony? I say, YES!!<br>
        Below is a musical mantra by an artist named Uyanga Bold who sings three words that Susan has been described as, which are also words Susan vows to live by.</p><br>
