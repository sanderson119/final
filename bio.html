        <h2>Susan C Anderson</h2>
        <h3> Who is this woman?</h3>
        <p id="white-foot">Her multifaceted and eclectic style has Susan engrossed in many interests with this particular website being dedicated to all things design.
        She is currently a Computer Science student at Great Bay Community College located in the seacoast region of Portsmouth, NH. While going into her second year with a focus on Digital Media Communications,  she has already  put together a collection of imagery and content that has already received great reviews. Susan's passions related to digital media  are video production/editing, web site development, copy writing and photoshop creations. Susan also LOVES being in front of the camera. You can call her ham if you'd like to but please know, Susan hasnt eaten meat in 9 months so the name may bring up some controversy if you try.</p>
        <p id="white-foot">Now what was all this other stuff Susan has passions for? To name a few, she has recently picked up an Austin acoustic guitar named "Luna" in attempts to learn and now has a Fender Squire electric guitar named "Sade" that is found to be much easier to play than the steel strings on Luna.<br>
        Susan is also extremely passionate about learning, specifically all things metaphysical and spiritual.  Susan believes a new movement deemed "New Thought Ministry" has surfaced to the forefront allowing many to fall in love once again with spirt. Being a part of that movement has been enriching to the soul.</p>
        <p id="white-foot" > Be careful not to misinterpret, mas her beliefs are near and dear to the heart and the  one thing she will not do is approach an unexpecting soul by expressing my devotion in an intense and aggressive way. Everyone has their own path and however one finds deep connection with spirit is fine by me, and Spirit!  Can Unity and Individualism live together in harmony? I say, YES!!<br>
        Below is a musical mantra by an artist named Uyanga Bold who sings three words that Susan has been described as, which are also words Susan vows to live by.</p><br>
       <p id="white-foot">Give it a listen!</p>
