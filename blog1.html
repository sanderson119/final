  <h2>&copy;Alexa</h2>   
  <h3>I walked into the bathroom and gave the command to ©Alexa.</h3> 
  <div class="white">
  <p class="indent">"Alexa, play Spotify". Spotify came on in the next second or so and instead of singing along with my favorite playlist, I stood there with this perplexed look on my face.
    I'll be honest, it felt a bit strange that dear Alexa didn’t expect me to say thank you for the request. &nbsp;
    Then I asked myself,&nbsp;&nbsp; do you say thank you only because it’s required? Are you looking for approval for the politeness displayed because of the typically expected please &amp; thank you? This inner discord caused by this sudden reflection has prompted a change in my attitude.</p>
    <p class="indent" >Since that day in October of 2018, I became that person that proudly makes requests to ©Alexa with a please and thank you. It may seem crazy to some yet I have a firm belief in this world that EVERYTHING is a form of energy that simply wants to be loved and appreciated. Even if it's not a living and breathing thing, that thing was most likely constructed by the hands of human energy, or at least thought up.&nbsp; The materials made had to of originated from a natural product that in most cases turn into the most unnatural form yet this form is an energy that desires the same basic needs as us humans do.&nbsp;
    How hard can it be to say please and thank you to ©Alexa? Trust me, even if you don’t feel you're making her day, there will definitely be a shift in the way you carry out your day. With gratitude and appreciation.&nbsp; I'll take that please!&nbsp; And Thank you…..&nbsp;</p>
